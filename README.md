### USES WHISPER AI

Over 700+⭐'s because this program this app just works! Works great for windows and mac. This whisper front-end app is the only one to generate a `speaker.json` file which partitions the conversation by who doing the speaking.

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=zackees/transcribe-anything&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#zackees/transcribe-anything&Date)

### New in 3.1!

Mac acceleration option using the new [lightning-whisper-mlx](https://github.com/mustafaaljadery/lightning-whisper-mlx) backend. Enable with `--device mlx`. Now supports multiple languages, custom vocabulary via `--initial_prompt`, both transcribe/translate tasks, and **batch processing** for improved throughput. 10x faster than Whisper CPP, 4x faster than previous MLX implementations!

**Batch Processing:** MLX backend supports `--batch_size` parameter (default: 12) for improved throughput. Higher batch sizes provide better performance but require more memory.

**Model Storage:** MLX models are now stored in `~/.cache/whisper/mlx_models/` for consistency with other backends, instead of cluttering your current working directory.

**GPU Accelerated Dockerfile**

Recently added in 3.0.10 is a GPU accelerated [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

If you are are doing translations at scale, check out the sister project: [https://github.com/zackees/transcribe-everything](https://github.com/zackees/transcribe-everything).

You can pull the docker image like so:

`docker pull niteris/transcribe-anything`

## About

Easiest whisper implementation to install and use. Just install with `pip install transcribe-anything`. All whisper backends are executed in an isolated environment. GPU acceleration is _automatic_, using the _blazingly_ fast [insanely-fast-whisper](https://github.com/Vaibhavs10/insanely-fast-whisper) as the backend for `--device insane`. This is the only tool to optionally produces a `speaker.json` file, representing speaker-assigned text that has been de-chunkified.

Hardware acceleration on Windows/Linux `--device insane`

MacArm acceleration when using `--device mlx` (now with multi-language support and custom vocabulary)

Input a local file or youtube/rumble url and this tool will transcribe it using Whisper AI into subtitle files and raw text.

Uses whisper AI so this is state of the art translation service - completely free. 🤯🤯🤯

Your data stays private and is not uploaded to any service.

The new version now has state of the art speed in transcriptions, thanks to the new backend `--device insane`, as well as producing a `speaker.json` file.

```bash
pip install transcribe-anything
# slow cpu mode, works everywhere
transcribe-anything https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
# insanely fast using the insanely-fast-whisper backend.
transcribe-anything https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ --device insane
# translate from any language to english
transcribe-anything https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ --device insane --task translate
# Mac accelerated back-end
transcribe-anything https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ --device mlx
# Mac accelerated with custom batch size for better throughput
transcribe-anything video.mp4 --device mlx --batch_size 24
# Use custom prompt for better recognition of specific terms
transcribe-anything video.mp4 --initial_prompt "The speaker discusses AI, machine learning, and neural networks."
# Load prompt from file
transcribe-anything video.mp4 --prompt_file my_custom_prompt.txt
```

#### Fastest Transcription - Use `insane` mode with model `large-v3` + `batching`

This is by far the fastest combination. Experimental, it produces text that tends to be lower quality:

- Higher chance for repeated text patterns.
- Timestamps in the vtt/srt files become unaligned.

It's unclear if this is due to batching or `large-v3` itself. More testing is needed. If you do this then please let us know the results by filing a bug in the issues page.

Large batch sizes require more significant amounts of Nvidia GPU Ram. For a 12 GB card, it's been experimentally shown that batch-size=8 will work on all videos from an internally tested data lake.

#### Insanely fast on `cuda` platforms

If you pass in `--device insane` on a cuda platform then this tool will use this state of the art version of whisper: https://github.com/Vaibhavs10/insanely-fast-whisper, which is MUCH faster and has a pipeline for speaker identification (diarization) using the `--hf_token` option.

Compatible with Python 3.10 and above. Backends use an isolated environment with pinned requirements and python version.

#### Speaker.json

When diarization is enabled via `--hf_token` (hugging face token) then the output json will contain speaker info labeled as `SPEAKER_00`, `SPEAKER_01` etc. For licensing agreement reasons, you must get your own hugging face token if you want to enable this feature. Also there is an additional step to agree to the user policies for the `pyannote.audio` located here: https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0. If you don't do this then you'll see runtime exceptions from `pyannote` when the `--hf_token` is used.

What's special to this app is that we also generate a `speaker.json` which is a de-chunkified version of the output json speaker section.

### speaker.json example:

```json
[
  {
    "speaker": "SPEAKER_00",
    "timestamp": [0.0, 7.44],
    "text": "for that. But welcome, Zach Vorhees. Great to have you back on. Thank you, Matt. Craving me back onto your show. Man, we got a lot to talk about.",
    "reason": "beginning"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPEAKER_01",
    "timestamp": [7.44, 33.52],
    "text": "Oh, we do. 2023 was the year that OpenAI released, you know, chat GPT-4, which I think most people would say has surpassed average human intelligence, at least in test taking, perhaps not in, you know, reasoning and things like that. But it was a major year for AI. I think that most people are behind the curve on this. What's your take of what just happened in the last 12 months and what it means for the future of human cognition versus machine cognition?",
    "reason": "speaker-switch"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SPEAKER_00",
    "timestamp": [33.52, 44.08],
    "text": "Yeah. Well, you know, at the beginning of 2023, we had a pretty weak AI system, which was a chat GPT 3.5 turbo was the best that we had. And then between the beginning of last",
    "reason": "speaker-switch"
  }
]
```

Note that `speaker.json `is only generated when using `--device insane` and not for `--device cuda` nor `--device cpu`.

#### `cuda` vs `insane`

Insane mode eats up a lot of memory and it's common to get out of memory errors while transcribing. For example a 3060 12GB nividia card produced out of memory errors are common for big content. If you experience this then pass in `--batch-size 8` or smaller. Note that any arguments not recognized by `transcribe-anything` are passed onto the backend transcriber.

Also, please don't use `distil-whisper/distil-large-v2`, it produces extremely bad stuttering and it's not entirely clear why this is. I've had to switch it out of production environments because it's so bad. It's also non-deterministic so I think that somehow a fallback non-zero temperature is being used, which produces these stutterings.

`cuda` is the original AI model supplied by openai. It's more stable but MUCH slower. It also won't produce a `speaker.json` file which looks like this:

`--embed`. This app will optionally embed subtitles directly "burned" into an output video.

# Install

This front end app for whisper boasts the easiest install in the whisper ecosystem thanks to [isolated-environment](https://pypi.org/project/isolated-environment/). You can simply install it with pip, like this:

```bash
pip install transcribe-anything
```

# Docker

We have a [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) that will be descently fast for startup. It is tuned specifically for `device=insane`. If you have extremely large batches of data you'd like to convert all at once then consider using the sister project [transcribe-everything](https://github.com/zackees/transcribe-everything) which operates on entire remote paths hierarchies.

# GPU Acceleration

GPU acceleration will be automatically enabled for windows and linux. Mac users can use `--device mlx` for hardware acceleration on Apple Silicon. `--device insane` may also work on Mac M1+ but has been less tested.

Windows/Linux:

- Use `--device insane`

Mac:

- Use `--device mlx`

#### MLX Batch Processing

The MLX backend supports batch processing for improved throughput on Apple Silicon:

```bash
# Default batch size (12)
transcribe-anything video.mp4 --device mlx

# Custom batch size for better performance
transcribe-anything video.mp4 --device mlx --batch_size 24

# Lower batch size for memory-constrained systems
transcribe-anything video.mp4 --device mlx --batch_size 6
```

**Batch Size Guidelines:**
- Default: 12 (good balance of speed and memory usage)
- Higher values (16-24): Better throughput but require more unified memory
- Lower values (4-8): Use if experiencing memory issues
- The optimal batch size depends on your model size and available unified memory

# Custom Prompts and Vocabulary

Whisper supports custom prompts to improve transcription accuracy for domain-specific vocabulary, names, or technical terms. This is especially useful when transcribing content with:

- Technical terminology (AI, machine learning, programming terms)
- Proper names (people, companies, products)
- Medical or scientific terms
- Industry-specific jargon

## Using Custom Prompts

### Command Line

```bash
# Direct prompt
transcribe-anything video.mp4 --initial_prompt "The speaker discusses artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neural networks."

# Load prompt from file
transcribe-anything video.mp4 --prompt_file my_custom_prompt.txt
```

### Python API

```python
from transcribe_anything import transcribe

# Direct prompt
transcribe(
    url_or_file="video.mp4",
    initial_prompt="The speaker discusses AI, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and deep learning algorithms."
)

# Load prompt from file
with open("my_prompt.txt", "r") as f:
    prompt = f.read()

transcribe(
    url_or_file="video.mp4",
    initial_prompt=prompt
)
```

## Best Practices

- Keep prompts concise but comprehensive for your domain
- Include variations of terms (e.g., "AI", "artificial intelligence")
- Focus on terms that Whisper commonly misrecognizes
- Test with and without prompts to measure improvement

# Usage

```bash
 transcribe-anything https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

```

## Develop

Works for Ubuntu/MacOS/Win32(in git-bash)
This will create a virtual environment

```bash
> cd transcribe_anything
> ./install.sh
# Enter the environment:
> source activate.sh
```

The environment is now active and the next step will only install to the local python. If the terminal
is closed then to get back into the environment `cd transcribe_anything` and execute `source activate.sh`

## Required: Install to current python environment

- `pip install transcribe-anything`
  - The command `transcribe_anything` will magically become available.
- `transcribe_anything <YOUTUBE_URL>`

## Updated version 2.3.0

`transcribe-anything` now works much better across different configurations and is now much faster. Why? I switched the environment isolation that I was using from my own homespun version built on top of `venv` to the AMAZING `uv` system. The biggest improvement is the runtime speed and re-installs. UV is just insane at how fast it is for checking the environment. Also it turns out that `uv` has strict package dependency checking which found a minor bug where a certain version of one of the `pytorch` dependencies was being constantly re-installed because of a dependency conflict that pip was apparently perfectly happy to never warn about. This manifested as certain packages being constantly re-installed with the previous version. `uv` identified this as an error immediately and was fixed.

The real reason behind `transcribe-anything`'s surprising popularity comes from the fact that it just works. And the reason for this is that I can isolate environments for different configurations and install them lazily. If you have the same problem then consider my other tool: https://github.com/zackees/iso-env
